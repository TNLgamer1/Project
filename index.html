        <h3>
            At the time of America's creation, two parties formed that had clashing ideas on how the nation should be ran. Two <br>
            of these parties were the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists (Democratic-Republicans) <br>

                The Election of 1800
            </h2>
            <br>
            <h3>After Thomas Jefferson won the election of 1800, the defeat of the Federalists had concluded their attempt to lead America on <br>
                a more conservative/centralized government and less democratic course. Never again have the Federalists since then played a national <br>
                political role after the defeat in 1800. This can show that most American voters at the time had shared the same beliefs aligning with Jefferson's view. <br>
                The Election of 1800 was the first election of the United States that involved two political paries contesting for power, as well as <br>
                it being the first time power was peacefully transitioned from political party to another
