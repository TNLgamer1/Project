        <h2>The First Barbary War</h2> <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            The First Barbary War (1801-1805) was the first overseas war fought by the United States. <br>
            Thomas Jefferson was in office at the time. Also known as the Barbary Coast War or the Tripolitan War, <br>
            it put the United States in a battle against pirates from nations collectively referred to as <br>
            the Barbary States. The nations of such of that took part were Morocco, Algiers, Tunis and Tripoli. <br>
            The United States ended up winning, along with peace treaties following between the three <br>
            Barbary States and Morocco.  <br>

                HOW <i>The First Barbary War</i> CONTRIBUTUES TO FREEDOM
            </h2> <br>
            Upon the United States' victory in the Egyptian city of Derma, the American flag was raised. This <br>
            was the first time that the United States had done so with a victory on foreign grounds. This can <br>
            show how willing the nation is to fight for their values and causes such as freedom. <br>

                Judicial Review 
            </h2> <br>
            Judicial review is the idea that the actions of the executive and legislative branches of government are <br>
            subject to review based on their relation to the constitution and if it is constitutional or not, thus <br>
            leaving room for judgement and potential invalidation <br>
            <br>
            This principle of judicial review was established in 1803 during the Marbury v. Madison case in which <br>
            James Madison denied delivery of documents and commissions. Marbury, joined by three other similarly situated <br>
            appointees, petitioned for a writ of mandamus regarding the delivery of the commissions. <br>
            <br>
            The Court did state that Madison’s refusal to deliver the commission was illegal, but did not make Madison deliver <br>
            Marbury’s commission through writ of mandamus. Instead, the Court decided held that the provision of the <br>
            Judiciary Act of 1789 giving Marbury the right to bring his claim to the Supreme Court was unconstitutional, <br>
            since it allegedly extended the Court’s terms of which Article III, Section 2, established. <br>
            John Marshall (hmm...) explained that a writ of mandamus was the best way to find a solution, <br>
            but concluded the Court simply can't execute it. Marshall tried to reason that the Judiciary Act of 1789 <br>
            was not constitutional. Congress did not rights to modify the Constitution through regular <br>
            legislation as the Supremacy Clause puts the Constitution as a higher priority than any laws. <br>
            Due to this, John Marshall (him again!) established the principle of judicial review, which is the <br>
            power to determine a law as unconstitutional. <br>

                HOW <i>John Marshall's Judicial Review</i>  CONTRIBUTUES TO FREEDOM
            </h2> <br>
            The power to declare laws unconstitutional allows for unfair laws to be filtered through quality and <br>
            allow the nation be as best as it can be so that it can stick to it's values
