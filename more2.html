        <h2>The Louisiana Purchase & Westward Expansion </h2> <br>
        <br>
        <h3>
            The Louisiana Purchase was a purchase that had expanded the States territory. This arrangement was proposed by <br>
            the senate of France. Which has been looked upon by Thomas Jefferson and was agreed upon. <br>
            All of this took place in 1803, during Thomas Jefferson's presidancy. The purchase brought <br>
            828,000 square miles of territory from France, nearly doubling the size of the nation. Nearly <br>
            or all of 15 states were eventually created from the newly settled land deal, which is considered <br>
            to be one of Jefferson's most important achievements during his presidancy. <br>
            <br>
            The Louisianna Purchase was also questioned whether or not to be constitutional, as per the beliefs of the Democratic-Republicans,<br>
            they were to follow the constituion strictly and word for word. Alongside that, there was no mention of <br>
            the president having the power to buy land in order to expand the territory of the nation.<br>
            Due to this, the purchase acknowledged the existance of implied powers of the federal Constitution.

                HOW <i>The Louisiana Purchase & Westward Expansion</i> CONTRIBUTUES TO FREEDOM
            </h2> <br>
            Upon the United States claiming this new land, they immediately expanded, and they soon recognized<br>
            the importance of implied powers. The nation is bound to change every now and then and is continually <br>
            changing, thus needing implied powers to be kept so that the freedom of the nation can remain intact <br>
