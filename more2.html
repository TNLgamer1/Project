        <h2>The Firstt Barbary War</h2> <br>
        <br>
        <h3>
            The First Barbary War (1801-1805) was the first overseas war fought by the United States. <br>
            Thomas Jefferson was in office at the time. Also known as the Barbary Coast War or the Tripolitan War, <br>
            it put the United States in a battle against pirates from nations collectively referred to as <br>
            the Barbary States. The nations of such of that took part were Morocco, Algiers, Tunis and Tripoli. <br>
            The United States ended up winning, along with peace treaties following between the three <br>
            Barbary States and Morocco.  <br>
            <br>

            <h2>
                HOW THIS CONTRIBUTUES TO FREEDOM
            </h2>
            Upon the United States' victory in the Egyptian city of Derma, the American flag was raised. This <br>
            was the first time that the United States had done so with a victory on foreign grounds. This can <br>
            show how willing the nation is to fight for their values and causes such as freedom.
