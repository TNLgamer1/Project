        <br>
        <h3>
            You awake soldier? Masks? Covid? 2021? What do you mean? It's 1812 and we have a war against the British we have <br>
            to fight. I'll give you the rundown. This War of 1812 is an armed conflict between the United States and the British <br>
            Empire. The British restricted our American trade since they feared it was harmful for their war with France. They also <br>
            want to set up an Indian state in the Midwest in order to maintain their influence in the region, which is why 10,000 <br>
            Native Americans are siding with the British. Since Canada's a British colony, those Canadians are also British <br>
            allies, thus putting us at a disadvantage. <br> <br>
            Us Americans don't like how the British Empire is restricting our trade and snatching our sailors to serve on British ships. <br>
            Since a Decleration wasn't enough, this war will surely free us from the British Empire once and for all <br>

                HOW <i>The War of 1812</i> CONTRIBUTUES TO FREEDOM
            </h2> <br>
            The international respect gained from America's victory over the British Empire, the world's leading military superpower <br>
            at the time, and promoted national pride among it's citizens. This finally proved that America was a nation seperate <br>
            from the British Empire, thus making them independant, and free.
