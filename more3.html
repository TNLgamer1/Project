        <h1>Welcome To Aland's Not So Amazing Website Part 4: Aaron Burr, sir...</h1> <br> 

        <h2>Hamilton vs. Burr </h2> <br>
        <br>
        <h3>
            The Hamilton v.s. Burr displayed rivalry between Hamilton and Burr. They both were in different political parties. <br>
            The election of 1800 had a lot to contribute to this. When Thomas Jefferson was running for president against Aaron Burr, <br>
            there was a draw. Hamilton does what he can do to change the fate of the president. Thomas Jefferson was elected <br>
            president and Aaron Burr as vice. In the following years, Thomas Jefferson along with Hamilton has attempted efforts <br>
            to keep Burr out of office. By 1804, Burr was officially out of office. <br>

                HOW <i>Hamilton vs. Burr</i> CONTRIBUTUES TO FREEDOM
            </h2> <br>
            This was the point in which the Federalist partry officially ended. Due to this, the Democratic-Republican party <br>
            was dominant. As the Federalists favored British relation, which is ironic due to the fact that the nation fought <br>
            for freedom from the British, having a Federalist America would simply undo all of that hard fought freedom. <br>
